timer seems to interfere with some printing operations
ways to display the time is becoming complex
variables are expanding very quickly, seem to use them once rather than happening a few times


use another timer to activate after seconds reach 60 ???

At first i tried to work with a variable passing of values and count from there but it kind of didnt work
Using array block and calculate the time from there and it had some issues
Then i tried to use total blocks and find the minute and seconds hand before calculating the time



2 timer
1 for milliseconds
1 for minutes and seconds


To put change colour inside the same if condition as second hand === 60 the program will hang
