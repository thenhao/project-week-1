timer seems to interfere with some printing operations
ways to display the time is becoming complex
variables are expanding very quickly, seem to use them once rather than happening a few times


use another timer to activate after seconds reach 60 ???

At first i tried to work with a variable passing of values and count from there but it kind of didnt work
Using array block and calculate the time from there and it had some issues
Then i tried to use total blocks and find the minute and seconds hand before calculating the time



2 timer
1 for milliseconds
1 for minutes and seconds


To put change colour inside the same if condition as second hand === 60 the program will hang

the counting of the elments was wrong as i was set on counting from 0 to 60 and hence my conditions would not be hit
as i am looking for condition when it is count = 60
Confusion as one count up while the other count down. The other count down to 0 first and the count up havent reach 60 and it went
to do other things

when troubleshooting, should put console.log at stages where the variable is accessed so that can filter through each section
